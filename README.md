Included Loot
This loot table includes a variety of items and gear from the following sources:

Snafu Weapons: Expect to find a selection of weapons from the Snafu Weapons arsenal. These items can provide unique advantages and firepower for your KOTH gameplay.

MMG Gear/ MMG Raid tools: Discover essential gear and raid tools related to MMG. These items can enhance your gameplay and provide strategic advantages.

Expansion Items: Explore expansion items that add depth and complexity to the KOTH mod. These items can change the way you approach the game and offer new challenges.

Breaching Charges: Find breaching charges that can be used to gain entry into secure areas and change the tide of battles.

KOTH Event Configuration
In addition to the loot table, I have added a chernarusplus.json file that controls when and how often KOTH events take place in the server. Here's the event configuration specified in the chernarusplus.json file:

KOTH events take place every 2 hours.
Events will only spawn once the server is populated with 3 or more players.
This configuration ensures that KOTH events are scheduled at regular intervals and only initiate when a sufficient number of players are present, creating a dynamic and engaging gameplay experience.

Usage

Feel free to customize and adjust the loot table and event configuration according to your preferences and server requirements. Remember to consult the KOTH mod documentation or community forums for additional information on mod usage and customization options.

Enjoy your enhanced KOTH gaming experience with this loot table! If you have any questions or encounter issues, please refer to the mod's Discord for assistance https://discord.gg/va8EDatHAQ
