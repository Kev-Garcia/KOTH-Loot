### Included Loot 

This loot table includes a variety of items and gear from the following sources:

Snafu Weapons: Expect to find a selection of weapons from the Snafu Weapons arsenal. These items mainly include Snafu 1-tap snipers and LMGs.

MMG Gear/ MMG Raid Tools: MMG gear and raid tools related to MMG mod. These items include raid saw, raid screwdriver, and MKV armor.

Expansion Items: These items include gold bars, gold nuggets, silver bars, and silver nuggets.

Breaching Charges: Find breaching charges from the breaching charge mod. This loot file contains one heavy breaching charge, along with a chance to spawn breaching charge build components.

## KOTH Event Configuration

In addition to the loot table, you have added a chernarusplus.json file that controls when and how often KOTH events take place on the server. Here's the event configuration specified in the chernarusplus.json file:

KOTH events take place every 2 hours.

Events will only spawn once the server is populated with 3 or more players.

This configuration ensures that KOTH events are scheduled at regular intervals and only initiate when a sufficient number of players are present, creating a dynamic and engaging gameplay experience.

Note: You have made some specific edits to the chernarusplus.json file:

You have moved the Krasno Airfield KOTH event out of range of an expansion trader safe zone, potentially increasing the challenge and excitement of the event.

Additionally, you have added KOTH events at town centers in Elektrozavodsk and Chernogorsk, providing players with more diverse locations to engage in KOTH battles.

These customizations aim to enhance the overall gameplay experience and strategic options available to players on your server.

## Usage

Feel free to customize and adjust the loot table and event configuration according to your preferences and server requirements. Remember to consult the KOTH mod documentation or community forums for additional information on mod usage and customization options.
